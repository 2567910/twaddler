# Twaddler

Twaddler is a simple chat server based on Elixir/Erlang. It is intended as learning project in order to get a better understanding about how Elixir works.

## Motivation

In one of our last projects at work we are using GraphQL as an API interface. Unfortunately we ran into performance issues which are mostly related to issue to be able do handle multiple requests to different services concurrently. 

This motivated me to finally give [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) a chance for it is know to be able to handle concurrent tasks very well - thanks to its erlang nature. 

Elixir also features a very nice GraphQL implementation called [Absinthe](https://absinthe-graphql.org/) which supports subscriptions in a very elegant way.

In order to better understand and learn Elixir I started working on a chat server with GraphQL support. 

Please note that this project is mostly intended as a learning project. But maybe other newbies like me will find the code useful :-)

## Thanks

I would like to thank the Elixir community for this great little language and I would also like to thank the Absinthe project for making with GraphQL fun.
